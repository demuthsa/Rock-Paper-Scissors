## Rock-Paper-Scissors

This was my first project using JavaScript. I decided to keep it simple and create the old school rock-paper-scissors game. This wasn't overly complicated as I just used functions to create this app with some added CSS styling.

If I ever revisit this application, I would implement OOP and put the functions into a class.
